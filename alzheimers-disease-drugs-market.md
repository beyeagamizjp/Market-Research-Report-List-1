<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alzheimer`s Disease Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cholinesterase Inhibitors</li><li>NMDA Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Alzheimer's Disease drugs market primarily comprises two key types: cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA antagonists. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, work by increasing levels of acetylcholine in the brain, which helps improve communication between nerve cells. NMDA antagonists, like memantine, regulate glutamate activity, preventing excessive excitation that can lead to neuron damage. Together, these drug classes aim to alleviate cognitive symptoms and improve quality of life for Alzheimer's patients by addressing underlying neurotransmitter imbalances.</p></p>
