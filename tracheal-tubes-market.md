<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tracheal Tubes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tracheostomy Tubes</li><li>EndoTracheal Tubes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tracheal tubes market consists primarily of tracheostomy tubes and endotracheal tubes, both essential for airway management. Tracheostomy tubes are surgically inserted into the trachea for long-term ventilation and are often used in patients with prolonged respiratory failure. Endotracheal tubes, on the other hand, are temporarily placed through the mouth or nose into the trachea to facilitate short-term mechanical ventilation during surgeries or acute respiratory distress. Each type addresses specific clinical requirements based on the patient's condition.</p></p>
